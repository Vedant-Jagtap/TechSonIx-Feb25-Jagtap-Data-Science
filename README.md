Data Science Project
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project involves working with a real-world dataset by performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model training. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data. EDA is conducted using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover patterns and insights. Finally, multiple machine learning models, including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and SVM, are trained and evaluated based on performance metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.
